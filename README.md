A bloonsTD like game with a level editor, you can draw a map set the points needed to follow, draw a "GameMask" to select where the player will be able to place towers

im stuck on this project because i dont know how to make it responsive, as of now it only works on big screens 1920*1080 

i also dont know how to make the enemies move smooth/not cause lag
